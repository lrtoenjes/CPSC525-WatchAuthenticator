Below is the breakdown of tasks that our group members worked on:

Jarret Spiker:

I worked on desinging and implementing the communication protocols and the UI for the access control system and the smart watch authenticator. I set up the projects, and a lot of the original framework which the apps are built on, including the threading, the system structure, the communication abstration, and the basic UI.

Scott Balston:


Luke Toenjes:

I worked on some of the communication protocols and cryptographic utilities that were
required for both the Access Control System and the Phone Authenticator Android 
applications. I also worked on creating the Pebble watch app prototype for communication
with the phone application, as well as for initiating an authentication request through
the watch.
