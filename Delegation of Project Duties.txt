Below is the breakdown of tasks that our group members worked on:

Jarret Spiker:

I worked on desinging and implementing the communication protocols and the UI for the access control system and the smart watch authenticator. I set up the projects, and a lot of the original framework which the apps are built on, including the threading, the system structure, the communication abstration, and the basic UI.

Scott Balston:

I worked on the Bluetooth communication during the initializing of the access control system and the phone authenticator, including activating Bluetooth on the devices, setting permissions for Bluetooth, making each device discoverable, searching for other devices, and the basic UI.

Luke Toenjes:

I worked on some of the communication protocols and cryptographic utilities that were
required for both the Access Control System and the Phone Authenticator Android 
applications. I also worked on creating the Pebble watch app prototype for communication
with the phone application, as well as for initiating an authentication request through
the watch.
